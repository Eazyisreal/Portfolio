# Portfolio

I created a simple portfolio website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

 It also includes the following features that should be used when creating a new portfolio website with HTML and CSS stylesheet  files.  

 It has links to different pages and also to my social media pages. It's work in progress. 

 I intend to update it in the future.
 
 I added a library for typewriter.
